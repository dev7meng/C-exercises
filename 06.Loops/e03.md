Program
```c
for (i = 5, j = i - 1; i > 0, j > 0; --i, j = i - 1)
    printf("%d ", i);
```
Output
```
5 4 3 2
```

##### Elaborate
The given program is same as:
```c
for (i = 5; i > 1; --i)
    printf("%d ", i);
```
since: 
- `i > 0, j > 0` is having comma operator - which discard the value of `i > 0`! Basically it the same as `j > 0` aka. `i - 1 > 0` aka. `i > 1`
- 3rd expression of the `for` loop decrease `i` by 1, `j = i - 1` do nothing to the output of the loop here
So, the computer will process like this: 
1. assign 5 to `i`
2. check if `i > 1`, obviously!
3. print `5 `
4. decrease `i`
...
