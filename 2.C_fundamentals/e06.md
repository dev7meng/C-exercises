Why is it not a good idea for an identifier to contain more than one adjacent underscore
EXAMPLE: `current__balance`

- I think it is such a non-sense decision since it doesn't help in term of visuality and also take you 1 extra keystroke
- Let say you have to do this because you want 2 identifier with same meaning. IMO this reason is already a bad idea and using `current_balance1` and `current_balance2` already seem easier and make more sense to identify 2 different in both visuality and logically terms
- Moreover, some font merge 2 underscore into 1 larger one, this make it uneccessary hard to identify one from another (especially for other programmers to read)
