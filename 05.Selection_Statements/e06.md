The statement is LEGAL ( it not produce error messenge when compile ) but not run as intended
When n is equal to 5:
- first, calculate the value of `1 - 10` ( 1 minus 10 ) as the precendence of arithmetic operators is higher than equally operators. `1 - 10` indeed equal to `9`
- then it compare n to `9`. In this case, 5 is not equal to 9 so it produce the value of `0`
- The program will not print anything
